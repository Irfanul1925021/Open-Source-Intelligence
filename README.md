# Open-Source-Intelligence
OSINT stands for open source intelligence, which refers to legally gathered information about an individual or organization from free, public sources. In practice, that tends to mean information found on the internet. Here in this repository there are collective resources to learn about the methodology and tools about OSINT which will be beneficial not only for CTFs as well as for doing real osint cases.
